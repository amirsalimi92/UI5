manifest.json:

sap.ui5 > models > invoice :

We had:
"type": "sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel",
"uri": "Invoices.json"

instead of:
"dataSource": "invoiceRemote"

because we didn't use ODATA before. Now we point the address of ODATA with
invoiceRemote, that defined in sap.app>dataSources in manifest.json!
